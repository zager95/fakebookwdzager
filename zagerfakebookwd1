   <h2 id="blue">About me</h2>
   <p style="background-color:orange;">I am a gastronomic tourism technician. I did an internship in my last year of high school at TIC Velenje, after high school I con􏰁nued my studies in Ljubljana at Department of Tex􏰁le and Clothing Engineering (VS) at the Faculty of Science and Technology. In 2016, I also started working through the student service, mostly in hospitality industry like Parliament pub un􏰁l 2018, a􏰀er which I immediately started with student work at the Triglav Sports Center in Bežigrad as a waiter, where I stopped working in 2020 to apply for my first full􏰁me job in the Slovenian army. A􏰀er comple􏰁ng basic training in the army, I started by working as a soldier in the Celje barracks and then in 2023 I was transferred to Postojna. This year I passed two licenses for classical and sports massage and at the same 􏰁me I am a􏰂ending a higher school for wellness. In addi􏰁on, I am ac􏰁vely working as a masseur. I have three years of expirience in selling various products such as souvenirs, various cosme􏰁c products and work in a gi􏰀 shop. I speak fluent English and fairly good Croa􏰁an. I have basic knowledge of Microso􏰀 Office Word, Powerpoint, Excel. I am an enthusias􏰁c lover of nature, sports and animals, and in my spare 􏰁me I find myself in to the company of the closest ones. I am happy to work with people because I also see the poten􏰁al for personal growth.
